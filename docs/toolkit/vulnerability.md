# Vulnerability Assessment Task

This task takes care of identifying the statistical properties of the fields of a dataset, trying to identify direct and quasi identifiers.

This identification is performed basically against a user defined k-anonimity model, which allowd the task to decide whether a field, or a combination of fields, contains rare (or unique) values.

The `taskConfiguration` field for this task accepts the following structure:

```json
{
    "algorithm": "DUCC",
    "fullReport": true,
    "k": 5,
    "nThreads": 1,
    "batchSize": 1,
    "strategy": null
}
```

Where `algorithm` contains the name of the algorithm used for the exploration, `k` defines the number of instances of each field-value combination for which it will be reported as unique. Hence, any field-value combination less then `k` will be considered as violating the constraints.
`nThread`, `batchSize` and `strategy` help in the parallelization of the exploration and are dependent on the algorith used.

## Exploration algorithm available

The vulnerability assessment task supports the following algorithms:

* **DUCC** as described in *S. Antonatos, S. Braghin, N. Holohan, Y. Gkoufas and P. Mac Aonghusa, "PRIMA: An End-to-End Framework for Privacy at Scale," 2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), Paris, 2018, pp. 1531-1542, doi: 10.1109/ICDE.2018.00171.*
* **BRUTE**
* **FPVI** as described in *A. Gkoulalas-Divanis, S. Braghin and S. Antonatos, "FPVI: A scalable method for discovering privacy vulnerabilities in microdata," 2016 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), Trento, 2016, pp. 1-8, doi: 10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580849.* 
* **MTRA** as described in *A. Gkoulalas-Divanis and S. Braghin, "Efficient algorithms for identifying privacy vulnerabilities," 2015 IEEE First International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2), Guadalajara, 2015, pp. 1-8, doi: 10.1109/ISC2.2015.7366170.*

The difference between the various algorithms is the strategy used in exploring the lattice representing all the combination of fields of the dataset.
