## Data Privacy Toolkit Spark Wrappers

What follows describes the spark wrappers available to leverage the functionality of **DPT** in a Spark environment.

The Spark JAR was built for Java 11 and Spark 3.2.3.
The wrappers are packaged together with its dependencies so there is no requirement for additional configuration of classpath or internet connection to artifact repositories.
