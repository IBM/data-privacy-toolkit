#Vulnerability detection API

## Available algorithms

The following algorithms are available for vulnerability analysis:

|Algorithm name|
|---|
|DUCC|
|Brute|

The Brute algorithm is fast but it cannot scale to large number of attributes.
The DUCC algorithm is slower but can scale to a very large number of attributes.

## Initialization

DUCC can be initialized via the following constructor:

```java
public DUCC(final int nThread, final Strategy strategy, int kValue);
```

where `nThread` is the number of parallel threads we want, `strategy` can be either `DUCC.Strategy.DESCENDING`, `DUCC.Strategy.RECURSIVE` or `DUCC.Strategy.WSYNC` and `kValue` is the uniqueness threshold. 

The Brute algorithms is initialized via:

```java
public Brute(int kValue);
```

where kValue` is the uniqueness threshold. 


## Detecting vulnerabilities on a CSV dataset

This example shows how to perform vulnerability analysis on a CSV dataset. We set the uniqueness threshold to 2, which means that any combination of columns that contains values that appear less than 2 times will be reported as a vulnerability.

```java
import com.ibm.research.drl.prima.IPVAlgorithm;
import com.ibm.research.drl.prima.datasets.IPVDataset;
import com.ibm.research.drl.prima.vulnerability.IPVVulnerability;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.util.Collection;
com.ibm.research.drl.prima.vulnerability.ducc.*;

public void printVulnerabilities(String filename) throws Exception {
		  //we load the dataset from a file
        IPVDataset dataset = IPVDataset.load(new FileInputStream(new File(filename)));

        int k = 2; //uniqueness threshold
        int numberOfThreads = 1; //number of threads

		 //we initialize the vulnerability detection algorithm and invoke it on the dataset
        IPVAlgorithm algorithm = new DUCC(1, DUCC.Strategy.DESCENDING, k);
        Collection<IPVVulnerability> vulnerabilities = algorithm.apply(dataset);

        for (IPVVulnerability vulnerability : vulnerabilities) {
            System.out.println(vulnerability);
        }
        
        //Example output:
        //[0,1]
        
        //this means that the combination of column 0 and 1 (zero-based indexing) is vulnerable
}
```
