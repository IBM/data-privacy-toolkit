I asked for Ms. Ball and the phone was handed off to what sound ed like an elderly women from someone who appeared to be a caregiver.  I asked if it was Ms. Ball and she said yes and  I told her who I was and that I was calling with Dr. Hammonds office where then she told me that she doesnt know who that is.  I then asked if her first name was Chloe and she responded in a way that I couldnt understand what she was saying.  But that is not her first name and she didnt know who I was asking for.  She thanked me and hung up the phone.   Because this isnt my doctor and I have never spoken with pt before I did not want to try the cell phone that was listed.
